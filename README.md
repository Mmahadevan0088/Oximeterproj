Machine learning model to detect SPo2 levels and predict hypoxemia using dataset from Kaggle
This repository contains the code developed for the project “Smartphone oximetry”, where physiological data simulating pulse oximetry readings was used to predict hypoxemia.
Dataset: The dataset used was obtained from Kaggle, containing oximetry-related features such as oxygen saturation (SpO₂), heart rate, and other physiological parameters.
Objective: To develop and evaluate a predictive model capable of detecting SpO2 levels and thenusing the sasme model to predict hypoxemia.

Methods: Data preprocessing and feature selection
Model comparison (Gaussian Process Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)

Final model: Gradient Boosting Regressor achieved the most reliable results.
Performance evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and ROC-AUC metrics.
Development Process- The code was developed in Google Colab with iterative testing and refinement. Version tracking and code documentation were maintained in this repository as part of the development process.
